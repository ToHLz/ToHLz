### Hello!!! 👋 welcome to my GitHub. Before you proceed, I would love to give you a brief overview of what is happening on my GitHub. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Recommendation Engine/ System (challenging, but I love the challenge 😁).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flask and Software development (in order to deploy the recommendation engine/system, I am learning everything about flask and how to use it for the purpose I want to achieve. Software Development is something I am dabbling into now because I got the opportunity to 😁)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Youtube
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Flask ( in as much as I enjoy learning independently, I also love learning from more experienced people 😊)
- 💬 Ask me about any Machine Learning technique
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn - Nancy Owolabi
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love singing (eventhough I sound like a drowning chicken 😂).
